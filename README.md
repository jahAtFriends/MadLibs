# MadLibs

A Mad Lib (in case you are not familiar) is a story with several words missing.
Those words are supplied by a person who does not know the text of the story,
only the part of speech of the word that needs to be supplied. At the end,
the words provided are inserted into the places of the missing words to comedic
effect.

## Assignment

In this project, you will create a program that plays MadLibs with a user. You
will first write a story with several blanks and prompt the user for the part
of speech they need to supply. Lastly, the program will print out the full
Mad Lib to the screen.

### Requirements

Your MadLib must contain __ten__ blanks. Of these you must have at least:

1. 3 Strings
2. 2 ints
3. 1 computation performed by the computer (not supplied by the user).

With the exception of (3), you should prompt the user for each of the inputs
needed to form the MadLib.

You should store each of these inputs in a variable that has a clear name so
that someone reading your code would know exactly where in the story that word
belongs. Variables should be in lowerCamelCase.

You should also have at least four good comments explaining sections of your
code. Comments should be full sentences with proper grammar and written in
"command style."

See the sample program for indications of good style including comments and
variable naming conventions.
